## Version 6 Enhancements

### WebSocket Stability Improvements
- **Connection State Management**: Prevents duplicate connections with `ws_connecting` and `ws_connected` flags
- **Exponential Backoff**: Progressive delays (5s → 10s → 20s → 40s → 80s → 160s → 300s max)
- **Race Condition Elimination**: Thread-safe WebSocket operations with proper locking
- **Connection Cooldown**: Minimum 2-second delay between connection attempts
- **Consolidated Reconnection**: Single reconnection path through main_loop()

### Configuration Flexibility
```python
# Hardware Connection Options
HARDWARE_HOST = "10.20.27.50"        # Real hardware (default)
# HARDWARE_HOST = "localhost"         # Simulator option
WEBSOCKET_URL = "ws://10.20.27.50:3001/events/stream"

# Configurable Limits
MAX_STATE_LOG_LINES = 60000          # Command-triggered state logs
MAX_EVENT_STATE_LOG_LINES = 1000     # Event-triggered state logs  
MAX_OCPP_LOG_LINES = 60000           # OCPP logs kept in memory
POLLING_INTERVAL = 60                # API polling frequency
LARGE_FILE_TIMEOUT = 300             # Timeout for large transfers
```

### Memory & Bandwidth Optimization
- **Smart Log Limiting**: Different limits for events (1,000 lines) vs commands (60,000 lines)
- **Streaming Processing**: Line-by-line processing for large files
- **Aggressive Cleanup**: Memory clearing after each server transmission
- **Bandwidth Control**: User-configurable event log sizes (500-2000 lines recommended)

### Production Features
- **CMS Health Monitoring**: Automatic connectivity checks every 10 seconds
- **Event Discarding**: No event storage when CMS disconnected (saves bandwidth)
- **Enhanced Logging**: Request/response tracking with size information
- **Error Classification**: Different handling for 500 errors vs connectivity issues

## Internet Data Consumption

**Daily Usage Estimates:**
- **Polling Data**: ~2.2 MB/day (1,440 polls × 1.5 KB average)
- **WebSocket Events**: ~7.5 MB/day (50 events × 150 KB average)
- **Total Daily**: ~10-12 MB/day typical usage

**Monthly Estimates:**
- Light usage (10 events/day): ~100 MB/month
- Normal usage (50 events/day): ~300-400 MB/month  
- Heavy usage (200 events/day): ~1-1.2 GB/month

**Bandwidth Optimization:**
- Event logs limited to 1,000 lines (configurable via `MAX_EVENT_STATE_LOG_LINES`)
- No event buffering when CMS disconnected
- CMS connectivity checks prevent wasted uploads

- Check WebSocket endpoint accessibility and port availability
- Monitor reconnection attempts in logs

**Memory Issues**:
- updated includes configurable memory limits and aggressive cleanup
- Adjust `MAX_EVENT_STATE_LOG_LINES` (500-2000) for bandwidth control
- Monitor container memory usage if issues persist

**CMS Connection Failures**:
- Client automatically monitors CMS health every 10 seconds
- Events are discarded (not buffered) when CMS disconnected
- Check network connectivity to HTTPS endpoints

**Large File Transfer Issues**:
- Configure `LARGE_FILE_TIMEOUT` based on network speed
- Adjust `MAX_STATE_LOG_LINES` to reduce transfer sizes
- Monitor timeout errors in logs

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging by modifying the script:

```python
websocket.enableTrace(True)  # Change to True for WebSocket debug logs
```

**updated Configuration Tuning:**

For bandwidth optimization:
```python
MAX_EVENT_STATE_LOG_LINES = 500    # Reduce for lower bandwidth usage
MAX_STATE_LOG_LINES = 30000        # Reduce for faster command responses
```

For memory optimization:
```python
MAX_RESPONSE_SIZE = 50 * 1024 * 1024  # Reduce to 50MB limit
MAX_OCPP_LOG_LINES = 30000            # Reduce OCPP memory usage
```

For timing adjustments:
```python
POLLING_INTERVAL = 30              # Increase polling frequency
LARGE_FILE_TIMEOUT = 600           # Increase timeout for slow networks
```

### Container Management

**View running containers**:
```bash
curl http://10.20.27.50:3001/docker-apps/containers/json
```

**View container logs**:
```bash
